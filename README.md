### NEO Monitor Standard
The purpose of this standard is to standardize the monitoring of NEO blockchains, primarily for mainnet and testnet. 

### NEO Vulnerability Bounty Program
The purpose of NEO Vulnerability bounty program is to be proactive about blockchain security by providing a channel for security researchers to report potential security vulnerabilities identified related to our underlying infrastructure. Everyone who find the vulnerabilities can send email to erik@neo.org. We will try our best to investigate those eligible vulnerabilities and fix the validity issues. All rewards will be paid in the equivalent amount of NEO.
